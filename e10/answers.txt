No matter we use schema or cache, the running time of reddit-0 is similar.

Schema and caching makes the running time of reddit-2b faster.

Reading the file seems to take more computational time than calculating the average.

I put cached the program right after calculating the max, i found this to be the most effective
spot to cashe my program. Putting the cache function at which is after calculating max, but
before selecting and joining has the fastest running time.
