1. I believe LOESS smoothing is better, because it has a smoother line. One difference i noticed about
the Kalman smoothing was that outliers affected the graph significantly. 

2. I believe that accelerometer would help with a better prediction. Suppose an individual begins running,
if we implemented an algorithm that notices a speed difference, we can minimize the noise from the 
latitude measurement from the bouncing of running. We could also use the extra information to adjust our
transition matrix values. silimarily with the gyroscope, we could see the rate of turning, pitch, roll and yaw.
