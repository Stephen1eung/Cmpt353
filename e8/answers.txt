1. The K neighbors and random forest models were fairly similar.
However the K neighbors classifer outperforms slighty and seems to do the best for the colour prediction. 
This is probrably because the dataset is considered large and clumped together. 
Therefore, with the nature of K neighbors; not allowing outliers to effect the performance drastically.
RGB LAB HSV most likely worked better for different models because of the differences in the alogirthm.

2. The models make various mistakes, I beleive this is because certain cities may have close whether conditions
which may throw off the modeling. The desnity of oxygen within the region may help with better predictions.
