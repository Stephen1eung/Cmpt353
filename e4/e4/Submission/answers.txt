1. I do not think that daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density.
This is because certain cities can have larger buildings like skyscrapers, and/or many more trees
that create shade. This could be a factor that affects the readings of daily temperature.

2. By allowing the program to decompress every time we ran our program it saves memory
on the hard drive, which allows for a faster read for the program. If the files were uncompressed
the computer would read files slower due to the memory difference, causing the program to be slower.
