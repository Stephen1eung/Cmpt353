1. In reddit_relative.py without .cache(), the program would have to recalculate many dataframes.
Which is one of spark's downsides of lazy evaluation as seen in the lecture. Spark will recalculate
the comments dataframe slowing down overall runtime. With .cache() spark is able to keep the memory
of comments and reuse it without recalculating / reading from the json file.

2. The runtime difference between broadcast and non-broadcast is not ever significant.
Although using broadcasts do reduce the runtime of the reddit relative program, the significance
may be far greater with larger datasets.

broadcast:
real 9.29
user 52.72
sys 2.39

non-broadcast:
real 12.36
user 52.144
sys 2.462
