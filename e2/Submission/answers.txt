1. The calculation is to find the least-squares regression value for 
the variables timestamp and ratings. The results give us a float vlaue 
which is the prediction of the tweets rating when considering the creation date.

2. It produces a fit line on the graph using the least-squares method, which 
find the best fitline that constains the least squares of error. Timestamp values are 
created_at values converted to time; therefore, by considering rating this allows 
us to generate the best fit line as well as plot the graph.
