1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, 
which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?

I found the NumPy calculations to be easier to work with. 
This was because of the slightly shorter commands; for example, 
when comparing “np.sum(counts, axis=0)” to “pd.DataFrame.sum(counts, axis=0)”. 
We can see that the NumPy command is much shorter which provides easier readability as well as less keystrokes.
When working with larger scaled projects, NumPy’s shorter commands would be much easier to work with.




2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?

The run time of pivot_months_pandas is 7.62 ms ± 86.6 µs per loop
The run time of pivot_months_loops is 193 ms ± 2.01 ms per loop

Seen in the results, the use of pandas is much faster. 
In this case, by using pandas we have achieved 25x faster than the conventional methods like the standard loops.
