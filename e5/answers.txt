1. When testing np.log, np.exp, np.sqrt, counts**2, np.sqrt seemed to come closest to 
satisfying the assumption t-test.

2. The p-value of the orignal t test and transformed values are smaller than 0.05; therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis 
and can assume the data is not normal distributed.

3. I think the fix 2: Central Limit Theorem came closest to answering the question of 
"do the number of comments on weekends and weekdays for each week differ?". This is because
all of the other fixes reject the null hypothesis.

4. On average there are more comments on the weekdays, this is most likely because the weekday consists of 
5 days whereas there are 2 on the weekend. When looking into the data between the two there are over twice as many
rows in weekdays than there are in weekend.
